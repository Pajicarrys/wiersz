        <h1>THE TWILIGHT</h1>

        <h4>by Zbigniew Jabłoński</h4>


        <p>
            The wind
            The change of barometrer hands
            Brings the anxiety of dream
        </p>


        <p>
            Waking up you fill your lungs
            By sigh which thins the loneless
            Supplies blood with joy of oxygen
            like water for fish
        </p>

        <p>
            Becouse there are tress
            Swinging by elastickness of branches
            Crockes suddenly rending the floor by roots
            And cracking trunk annoucers the world
            The brutality of nature
        </p>

        <p>
            The shell of the earth
            Floods the body pulsing with redness
            Giving up under the force of air
            The time of the sea trial
            Shaky flight of a diving sea-gull
            Pulls out from the flesh of Baltic
            The glare of fish scale
            Steel shadow of the ship
            Cuts the horizon by merciless stroke of the screw
        </p>


        <p>
            Like a bar destroying walls of citadels
            Neptunes anger changes the hell of volcano ashes of
            Bottom into furious froth
            The twilight by the red cloth of setting sun
            Is gently dressing the wound
        </p>
